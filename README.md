This work primarily investigates the budding process during SARS-CoV-
2 infection. To do so, the membrane from cryo-TEM images of infected cells is
segmented. The samples consist of different compositions regarding the envelope
structural protein (E). This segmentation provides a discrete representation of the
actual membrane and serves as the starting point of this study. Based on the
structure of the segmented membrane, its properties are extracted. The mean
curvature and Gaussian curvature of the membrane are estimated by fitting the
surface data. The membrane’s curvature can be used as a comparison criterion
between membrane structures of differently prepared cell infections. In this context,
the role and influence of the envelope protein are of particular interest. Additionally,
assigning curvature values enables an automatic classification of the viral bud into
neck and envelope regions. The high resolution of the microscopic images (∼ nm)
allows for an analysis of membrane thickness. This can be used to correlate the
membrane’s location with its corresponding thickness. Finally, the Surface Evolver
program is used to investigate the energy and shape of the budding neck regions. The
software minimizes surfaces whose energy and boundary conditions are determined
by the Helfrich Hamiltonian and the given data. The results serve to compare
the shape of the experimental data with the shape of the minimized surface under
given parameters of spontaneous curvature, bending rigidity, and surface tension.
Within this framework, these parameters can be analyzed in relation to each other.
Assuming low surface tension, the spontaneous curvature of the membrane in the
neck region can be estimated.


# VLP Curvature Analysis

This repository provides tools for curvature analysis and membrane modeling, including analytical Python scripts and simulations using [Surface Evolver](https://facstaff.susqu.edu/brakke/evolver/evolver.html).  
The goal is to analyze curvature patterns in virus-like particles (VLPs), especially in budding neck regions.

## Environment Setup

To create the required conda environment for the Python scripts:

```bash
conda env create -f env_from_history.yml
conda activate <your_env_name>
``` 

### 🗂️ Repository Structure

### `Curv_Analysis_Functions/`
General functions for curvature analysis, including methods to estimate mean and Gaussian curvature from 3D meshes or point clouds.
