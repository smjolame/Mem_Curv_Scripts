number behind text: gridsice
number after that: dimension (1 = const lambda, 2 = changing lambda)
next number: lambda value
All these belong to a h_zero of [-0.3, 0.6] in lin steps and lambda [1,50] in log steps


special numbers:
last number is a different interval:
1: h_zero[-0.1, 0.4] -> for the region between bifork
2: h_zero[-0.2,0.2] -> for energy minimum
3: h_zero[-0.1,0.1]
